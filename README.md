# NORMALIZATION

Normalization
Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database.
Normalization is used to minimize the redundancy from a relation or set of relations. It is also used to eliminate the undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies.
Normalization divides the larger table into the smaller table and links them using relationship.
The normal form is used to reduce redundancy from the database table.
Types of Normal Forms
There are the four types of normal forms:


DBMS Normalization
Normal Form	Description
1NF	A relation is in 1NF if it contains an atomic value.
2NF	A relation will be in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.
3NF	A relation will be in 3NF if it is in 2NF and no transition dependency exists.
4NF	A relation will be in 4NF if it is in Boyce Codd normal form and has no multi-valued dependency.
5NF	A relation is in 5NF if it is in 4NF and not contains any join dependency and joining should be lossless.
